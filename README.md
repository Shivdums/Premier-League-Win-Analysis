Worked on python for this Project Using libraries such as pandas, seaborn and matplotlib.
This project delves into an in-depth analysis of match outcomes in the Premier League and La Liga, focusing on understanding which teams have emerged victorious over the years. 
The primary methodology involves parsing and examining match data, specifically dissecting full-time results to discern winners.
The algorithm compares both team scores, declaring the team with the higher score as the winner.
Leveraging the insightful seaborn library, the project visually represents the accumulated data through pie charts, 
providing an intuitive visualization of the win distribution among all Premier League and La Liga teams.
This comprehensive approach not only allows for a quick grasp of each team's success rates but also offers a comparative view between the two prestigious football leagues.
Through this exploration, the project aims to uncover trends, patterns, and potential insights into the competitive landscape of these premier football leagues.
Thank yew.
